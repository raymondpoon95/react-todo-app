This is a Todo app created with React and CSS. It allows you to add, remove and update your todo list. Furthermore this app uses localStorage to persist your data, so it will not be lost even on refresh. 

## ðŸš€ Getting started

1. **Install the site locally to make any changes.**
    
    First you want to download the repo locally, do so by using ```git clone``` followed by the url to the repository.
    
    Or just copy and paste this into your terminal ```git clone https://github.com/raymondpoon95/react-todo-app.git```
    
    Now before you try and run the project it is important to use npm install first, as this project uses npm and has peer dependencies.
    ```npm install```
    
2. **Getting it up and running.**

    Make sure that you have ```Node``` installed on your machine before running the next line of code.
    
    If you do not understand how to install node here is a [small guide](https://nodejs.dev/download/package-manager/) that you can follow.
    
    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.
    
    ```
    npm run start
    
3. **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Now you should be able to see it running locally at `http://localhost:3000/`
    
    Now you can start changing the code as much as you want and you will be able to see the changes in real time as well! ðŸ˜Ž
